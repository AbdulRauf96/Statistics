    "A/B Testing is a method of comparing two versions of a product, website, or app to determine which one performs better. It is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. A is the control and B is the treatment. A is the version that is currently in use, and B is the version that is being tested. The goal is to determine if B is an improvement over A. If B is an improvement, then B becomes the new control and the process is repeated with a new version of B."
